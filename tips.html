        Strategy for exams

1: Optimal sleep time for me is around 8 hours, with absolute minimum of around 4 hrs.

2: Try to start studying for any big tests well in advance(several days) even if for short amount of time.

3: Attend tutorials  or review sessions (The fact that they get you to think about the material is what counts.

Tips 1 - 3 are general

tests-preparation:

4: Considering the Big picture and Organisation is the key

5: Create Schedule of study even though you don't stick to it(Getting the Idea of everything I need to know)
    write it down in bullet points and how long it will  take you to get them down if you don't do this your tendency
     to spend too much time on the beginning of the material and then skim through the (most important) later
     material due to lack of time.
6: Always try to look at previous tests BEFORE starting to study. past tests were written by the same professor.
     will give you strong hints about how you should study.
     Don't actually attempt to complete the questions in the beginning, but take careful note of the type 
     of questions.

7: Reading and understanding IS NOT the same as replicating the content.
    read a formula it makes perfect sense but once you start to do it becomes really difficult
    this two things use different parts of the memory.
    	WHAT I CANNOT CREATE I DONOT UNDERSTAND KNOW HOW TO SOLVE EVERY PROBLEM THAT HAS BEEN SOLVED.

8: Collaborate with others but near the end:
    study alone first because in early stages of Studying others can only serve as a distraction.
    but near the end get together they will often point out important pitfalls, give you the opportunity to teach.

9: hung out with weaker students you have to explain to them the material (helps a lot in understanding)

10: go to the professor 1 on 1 they will disclose you something really special

11: Study well in advance THIS IS THE KEY REALLY the brain needs time to absorb material. Things that look hard
     becomes easier with time . Allocate ~3 days for midterms and 6 days for exams.

12: If things are goin badly and you get too tired, in emergency situations, jug an energy drink
     they work it's just chemistry

13: For things like maths EXERCISE > READING:
					It is good to study to the point where you are reasonably ready to start 
      the EXERCISE  FILL THE GAPS THROUGH EXERCISE IF YOU HAVE MANY AVAILABLE TO YOU.
      THE EXERCISE WILL ALSO MAKE YOU GO BACK AND READ THINGS YOU DON'T KNOW.

14: Study in places where other people study as well
